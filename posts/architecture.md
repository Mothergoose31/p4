When starting a project, it's important to plan ahead, Instead of jumping in and begin working. While this might seem efficient (after all, who wants to spend time planning when they could be doing), it can ultimately be inefficient. In fact. One of the characteristics that distinguishes senior developers from junior developers is that Senior devs spend more time planning their approach to a project and less time actually completing it, while juniors do the reverse. Rushing through the planning stage and spending far more time overall.

Working on Microservice development over the past year has taught me many things about working efficiently. In this article, I will briefly summarize what I have learned.

It's important to be cognizant of Architecture.
Imagine.  You're halfway through coding a microservice, you're using MongoDB, and your higher-ups decide to go with  Amazon Aurora, then two weeks later to DynamoDB, then back to MongoDB again.

In the absence of any consideration for the architecture, this would be a time-consuming task.
 A good starting point. Is the book. Clean Architecture by Robert C Martin. It presents various principles for designing software that structure it logically and make development, maintenance and augmentation way easier.

###  Metacognition
Metacognition, or “thinking about thinking” refers to your awareness of yourself as a learner and your ability to regulate your own learning.
Metacognition involves 4 distinct skills:

 - Assessing the  Project —Getting a handle on what is  involved and breaking it down into smaller tasks and any constraints (time, resources).
 - Evaluating your strengths and weaknesses—Evaluating your own skills and knowledge in relation to a task. 
- Apply strategies and monitor your performance
- Reflect and adjust if needed—Look back on what worked and what didn't work so that you can adjust your approach next time and, if needed, start the cycle again.

At the end of each day, take a moment to write down where you left off, what needs to be done, what issues you encountered... etc. This is especially important on a Friday so you don't have to scratch your head on Monday to remember where you left off.


## Dont Be afraid to ask for help! 
Ask for help if  youve been stuck  more than 30 minutes!
 The fear of being considered dumb for not knowing how to do whatever task we're asking about keeps us from asking for help.
 Just do it! , hop on a teams call and ask they " Hey do you remember how to do ____"
